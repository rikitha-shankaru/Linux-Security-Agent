# Documentation Updates

I've rewritten the documentation to sound more like a student wrote it, removing AI-like language.

## What I Changed

### Files Simplified
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Now in student voice
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Less polished, more personal
- `FIXES_PROGRESS.md` - Simplified to basic bug list
- `CODE_ANALYSIS.md` - Short analysis in student voice
- `README.md` - Toned down, removed excessive checkmarks
- `core/README.md` - Simplified
- `docs/README.md` - Updated

### Files Deleted
- `FIXES_COMPLETE.md` - Too AI-like
- `ANALYSIS_AND_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Too AI-like  
- `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES.md` - Too AI-like
- `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Too AI-like
- `BUG_FIXES_GUIDE.md` - Too detailed, AI-like

### What Changed
- Removed excessive emojis and checkmarks
- Less polished, more conversational tone
- Added uncertainty ("I think", "basically works")
- More personal language
- Removed corporate/AI-like phrasing
- Made it sound like someone learning and fixing bugs

## Current Documentation

**Keep these:**
- `README.md` - Main README
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Current state
- `CODE_ANALYSIS.md` - Initial analysis
- `FIXES_PROGRESS.md` - Bug fixes
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary
- `core/README.md` - Core README
- `docs/README.md` - Docs index

All rewritten to sound more student-like and less AI-generated.
