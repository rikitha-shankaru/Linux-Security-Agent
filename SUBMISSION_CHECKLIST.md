## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### When Professor Asks:

**"What does your tool do?"**
> "It's a Linux security agent using eBPF for kernel-level syscall monitoring and ensemble ML for anomaly detection. It detects threats in real-time with 0% CPU overhead."

**"How is it different from existing tools?"**
> "Most tools like Falco use rule-based detection. My innovation is using ensemble machine learning (3 algorithms) which can detect zero-day attacks and adapts over time with incremental learning."

**"Where did training data come from?"**
> "Synthetically generated based on research literature, following academic standards like DARPA IDS and NSL-KDD datasets. 850 samples across 8 behavior types. Fully documented in TRAINING_DATA_SOURCES.md."

**"Does it really work?"**
> "Yes - verified on Google Cloud VM. Captures 100+ events/second, detects threats with anomaly scores 40+ (vs 21 for normal), and has 0% CPU overhead. Evidence in FINAL_VALIDATION_REPORT.md."

**"What's your MITRE coverage?"**
> "68% (13/19 techniques) including privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, and C2 beaconing detection. Documented in MITRE_ATTACK_COVERAGE.md."
