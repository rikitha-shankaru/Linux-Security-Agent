   - Optional cloud integration for centralized management
   - Agent registration and heartbeat
   - Event transmission and remote configuration

### Risk Scoring System

| Risk Level | Score Range | System Calls            | Examples                                  |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Low**    | 1-2 points  | Normal operations       | `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`          |
| **Medium** | 3-5 points  | Potentially suspicious  | `fork`, `execve`, `chmod`, `mount`        |
| **High**   | 8-10 points | Very suspicious         | `ptrace`, `setuid`, `setgid`, `chroot`    |

### Action Thresholds

- **Warning**: 60% of main threshold (SIGUSR1)
- **Freeze**: 120% of main threshold (SIGSTOP)
- **Kill**: 180% of main threshold (SIGKILL)

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```bash
# Linux (with eBPF)
sudo python3 security_agent.py --dashboard

# macOS (simulation mode)
python3 security_agent_mac.py --dashboard --threshold 30

# Run with timeout (auto-stop after 30 seconds)
python3 security_agent_mac.py --dashboard --timeout 30

# JSON output for integration
python3 security_agent_mac.py --output json
```

### Advanced Features
```bash
# Enable anomaly detection
python3 security_agent_mac.py --anomaly-detection

# Enable automated actions (DANGEROUS)
python3 security_agent_mac.py --enable-kill --threshold 80

# Full feature set with timeout
python3 security_agent_mac.py \
    --dashboard \
    --anomaly-detection \
    --threshold 40 \
    --timeout 300 \
    --action-log /tmp/security_agent.log
```

### Demo Testing
```bash
# Run normal behavior demo
python3 demo/normal_behavior.py

# Run suspicious behavior demo
python3 demo/suspicious_behavior.py

# Run both demos
python3 demo/run_demo.py
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Risk scoring system
- ✅ Process monitoring
- ✅ Anomaly detection
- ✅ Action handling
- ✅ Integration tests

### Demo Validation
- ✅ Normal behavior: Low risk scores (0-20)
- ✅ Suspicious behavior: High risk scores (50-100)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Linux**: Uses BCC (Berkeley Packet Capture) for efficient kernel-level monitoring
- **macOS**: Uses psutil simulation for process monitoring (no eBPF support)
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when eBPF is not available
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: <5% CPU overhead on both platforms

### Machine Learning
- Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection
- Feature extraction from system call patterns
- Automatic model training and persistence

### Safety Features
- Kill actions disabled by default
- Permission checks before taking actions
- Comprehensive logging of all operations
- Frozen processes can be unfrozen

## 📊 Risk Assessment Examples

### Normal Process (ls command)
```
PID 1234: ls (Risk: 5.2, Anomaly: 0.15)
Syscalls: read, stat, getdents, close
```

### Suspicious Process (python → bash → chmod +s)
```
PID 5678: python3 (Risk: 85.3, Anomaly: -0.45)
Syscalls: execve, setuid, chmod, ptrace, chown
Action: FROZEN (SIGSTOP sent)
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Production Deployment
- Run with root privileges for eBPF access
- Secure log files with proper permissions
- Monitor action logs for false positives
- Test thoroughly in isolated environment

### Safety Measures
- Kill actions require explicit enablement
- All actions are logged with timestamps
- Frozen processes can be recovered
- Configurable thresholds for different environments
