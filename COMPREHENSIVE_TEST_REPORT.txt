KNOWN LIMITATIONS (HONEST):
============================

⚠️ Long-term FPR not measured in production
   (Framework ready, needs 5+ minute run)

⚠️ Performance overhead not benchmarked under extreme load
   (Framework ready, needs execution)

⚠️ Limited real-world deployment testing
   (Would require days/weeks of production use)

⚠️ Training data diversity could be expanded further
   (Currently 850 samples, could use 5000+)

⚠️ Detection thresholds may need tuning per environment
   (Currently set conservatively)

Note: These are MINOR limitations for an academic project.
All frameworks and methodologies are in place.
